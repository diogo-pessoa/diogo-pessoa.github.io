## Filter

> filter(function or None, iterable) --> filter object
> Return an iterator yielding those items of iterable for which function(item)
> is true. If function is None, return the items that are true.

## The power of combining both

A map can call a filter to apply a transformation on a reduced set of values.

```python
    def test_mapping_filtering(self):
        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
        squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
        print(list(squared))
```

```python
    

<class 'filter'>
filtered evens: [2, 4]
resulting map:  [4, 16] # squared of the filtered evens

filter(function or None, iterable) --> filter object
   Return an iterator yielding those items of iterable for which function(item)
   is true. If function is None, return the items that are true.
```

## Reduce

Apply function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of iterable, from left to right, to reduce
the iterable to a
single value.
