## Introduction

When I recently left my full-time job after around 6 years. Even though, it was my
decision to move on. I still had moments of sadness, anger, and doubt during my last
days. When I came across **Kübler-Ross and Kessler (2005), The five stages of
grief helps individuals understand their loss** [1](#references). I contextualised
experience and the descriptions of the 5 stages of grieving.

## The "loss" of a job

Much like a loss of a loved one, leaving a job causes a massive change in
routine and relationships.

To avoid being too nostalgic, here's a few things nobody ever misses in any job, old or
new:

* The endless meetings. Where the people talking the most, are the ones with the least
  to say.
* The “know-it-alls” with a one-stop solution to every problem.
* The authoritarian bosses `(who refer to themselves leaders)`. Who asks you to work
  harder during the holiday season because the company needs you. Meanwhile, they're
  enjoying time with their families. When they come back from their holiday, they expect
  results `(your results)`. Which, they'll happily take credit for.

It might sound like I'm describing a single job. But, am I? When we look around, these
stereotypes are present in most companies.

With that out of the way, we move on.

Even when it's the worker's choice to leave. There are many things left behind.

* The familiarity with the work.
* The pet-projects you helped from the start.
* The familiar faces by the water cooler.
* The casual fun interactions with
  teammates `(and yes, video-calls are just as good as face-to-face, it's 2024, get over it)`.

There was a feeling of emptiness when thinking of the list above. I came to realise
that's **grief**.

## The five stages of grieving

A worth quote regarding the _stages_ _“They are
responses to loss that many people have, but there is not a typical response to loss, as
there is no typical loss. Our grief is as individual as our lives.”_ – Kübler-Ross and
Kessler  (2005, p. 25) [1](#references)

### Denial

When you have a notice period, you're still in the company, you're still working. It's
easy to forget that you're leaving. You're still in the same place, doing the same
things. Whereas when it's a sudden change, where you leave the same day. The sudden
change can take time to sink in. It almost feels as a long holiday. It takes time to
sink in. You're not going back to the office.

### Anger

This is a strange one for me. Anger is a struggle to keep in check. In the context of
leaving by choice. I compare it to the sense of frustration when your expectations
aren't met. I'm not a fan of the blame game. And, it's easy to play stories in your
head, creating the us-vs-them narrative.

When you're laid off. It's easy to direct the anger at the company, the boss, the
unreasonable expectations. It's a natural response to the loss of a job.

### Bargaining

This is the stage where I started to think about the “what-ifs”. In my case, I reasoned
by trying internal interviews or delaying the inevitable. Trying to justify the delay in
the hope of things getting better. The truth is. I was done, I had already to moved on.
But you
linger, you let yourself work on autopilot for a few more weeks.

When being laid off, I can only think of this stage as more intense. You might try to
negotiate or believe you can revert it somehow. It's a mind-trap, letting this go on,
can cause a loop, fluctuating with anger and bargaining.

### Depression

“Depression is not a sign of mental illness. It is the appropriate response to a great
loss”
— Kübler-Ross and Kessler (2005 p. 50) [1](#references)

I confess when you decide to leave, you're already looking forward to the next
chapter. There's a sense of anticipation that reduces the sadness. Regardless, the last
days
are tough. You're leaving a lot behind, the familiar faces, the routine. It's a loss,
and it's okay to feel sad about it.

If you were laid off, the depression can be more intense. The sense of loss, mixed with
the sense of powerlessness is overwhelming. It's easy to cycle back through anger and
hope at this point.

### Acceptance

In accepting the change, you're acknowledging the loss, and getting ready for the next
move. It doesn't mean you're happy about it. It means you're acknowledging the facts as
they are and act within your control.

## The Story we tell ourselves

Storytelling is powerful. How we frame it influences on how we navigate
grieving.

When moving on, the story is vivid, sometimes painful, and often it captures all your
attention. We can get caught up in the story.

The term “ruminating” comes to mind, Jessica McCabe in her channel "How to ADHD", talks
about [thoughts-spiral](https://youtu.be/_x9Y77Ta83I?si=-vqQXjFcRaRaeBlZ). It's
important to get yourself out of the thought spiral. To heal.

We need to re-frame the story, to address the thought-spiral, what worked for me was
writing it down. Dale Carnegie in his
book “How to stop
worrying
and start living” [2](#references) has a chapter on “How to face trouble”.

He suggests writing down the problem, the worst that can happen, and the solution. It's
a simple exercise. But, it helped me putting things in perspective and think in larger
time scales.

Here are the steps in more details:

1. **Get the Facts**
    * when getting facts, pretending you're collecting it for someone else.
    * prepare to argue the other side (devil's advocate)
    * write down both sides, (write the facts) A problem well stated is a problem half
      solved
2. **Ask yourself, and write down the answer**
    * What Am I worrying about?
    * What can I do about it?
    * Here's What I'm going to do about it.
    * When I'll
      start? `(This the most important step. Having a deadline, it makes it concrete)`

## Getting Closure

Common definition: “act of closing or the state of being closed; a
bringing to an end, a conclusion.”

_“closure has taken on the clichéd meaning of “wrapping up a situation.” We are
pressured to find closure on the work situation, the romantic relationship, and even on
a
death.”_ – Kübler-Ross and Kessler (2005 p. 244) [1](#references)

_“In the loss of a young loved one such as Johnny, people may oversimplify the stages.
We
expect six months of denial, then a few months of anger and depression, followed by some
bargaining. Finally, we expect to find acceptance, which we imagine will lead to some
type of “closure. **It’s never as easy as items on a checklist**”_ – Kübler-Ross and
Kessler (2005 p. 246) [1](#references)

When you spend a long time in a place, collecting stories, building memories, learning
from people, teaching the younger generation. That place becomes a part of your story.
Trying to “get over it” is not the point. Trying to Suppress is another for of
_**Denial**_.
When you look back on those moments with nostalgia. When the anger and
resentment, gives way to a smile. You've found closure.

## Final Thoughts

_“Grief is the intense emotional response to the pain of a loss. It is the reflection of
a connection that has been broken. Most important, grief is an emotional, spiritual, and
psychological journey to healing.” _ – Kübler-Ross and Kessler (2005 p.346)

When you're closing a chapter, **grieve**, **feel it** whatever you need to feel. But,
do
it deliberately,
acknowledge, reflect over the moments, and draw the story to an end. Not the end, **”
an”** end, that last job was a Chapter. There's a whole new
world of experiences. Indeed, fear is constant company. But that just means
you
living a complete set of first times, fear is a healthy response will make you alert,
use it and get moving again.

If you're one of those who believes our story is already written. Here's an analogy.
You're making unplanned additions to your story, if anything, you're making that book
more
interesting.

I choose to accept and embracing randomness. We're lucky to be here, lucky to have
worked there and collected some stories. Whatever happens next, it's a bunch of
random events, they can go either way.
So if you left a bad job, there's a good chance it will get better. Lucky you!

`If it gets worse, sorry to hear. Don't lose heart, Probability helps here too, in flipping coins the chances of a streak are low. So, keep flipping that coin.`
