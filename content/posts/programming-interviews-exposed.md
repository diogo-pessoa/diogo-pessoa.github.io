## Summary

The Programming interview Exposed covers the essential topics for preparing for a
technical interview (in software development). I'm trying to capture the essence of the
proposal and structure into steps. Then, I can structure my thought and preparation for
preparing and sitting through an interview.

### Conventions Used in all my notes

I'm borrowing the approach, I often see in O'Reilly books. I think it's really cool, and
it helps as you reads other books following a similar convention. Here it goes:

* _Italic_ - I'll use for quotations from the book: _The following typographical
  conventions are used in this book:_
* `code` - I'll use this for code snippets, as intended in markdowns. However, I'll also
  use it to call attention to my personal notes.
    * `note to self` - `[Revised]` - these notes will come in a > blockquote too.
* `[Revised]` - yeah, that came just after the update on the previous bullet. If I'm
  updating something, `[Revised]` will follow the change (hopefully, I'll tell me why).
* `(random comments inline)` - yeah, it's superbad practice, but I often, add
  comments mid-sentence `(most of them useless, see what I did here?)`. That's just how
  my brain works, and I noticed, I enjoy my reading later when I have those. It's like
  I'm feed my need for a distraction, by embedding it in the text. :thinking:
    * `(I held a vote, and I won)`.
* **Big Words Warning:** - That's for when I'm using cunning words to sound
  sophisticated, but serves the puporse of anchoring to a familiar idea.
* **_"Quotes"_** â€“ author - when I'm quoting literally quoting the author, I'll use this
  format.
* I'll liberally use emojis, This is a personal note, get over it.
* I might throw in some other markdown stuff, I can't think of now, and can't be
  bothered to look up.
    * [Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) - that will do.
* Check Glossary of terms in the end. In Technical books, there's a lot of jargon,
  Acronyms, and contractions. All of which I often forget.

## My notes

### From Chapter 3: Approach to Programming Problems

`That's right! I skipped a bunch of pages` :grimacing:

#### Basics

1. _Make sure you understand the Problem_

2. _Once you understand the problem, try an example._

> `note to self`: Once you understand the problem (go back to step 1, you're
> probably
> rushing). If this is the second-time you're reading this. What worked for me
> before to
> fully understand the problem was to write down the brute-force solution.

* As I wrote the brute-force solution. The problem became clearer. I elaborated
  questions, and most importantly, I proved my initial assumptions wrong.
* Keep in mind this could take some of your interview time(it's worth it).

3. _Focus on the algorithm you will use to solve the
   problem_ `(Once your have the brute-force solution, you already solved the problem,
   it's crap,
   but solved)`.
    * It now a refactoring problem. It's much easier to solve smaller problem.
    * Review the constraints, they may be useful restructure the code.
        * for Example: In a problem in counting characters (a-z,A-Z,0-9) where space is
          a constraint.
            * you can use
              a [Counter()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter)
              collection (not talking about the tech solution, if you curious follow the
              link).
            * That helps, because the constraint tells you only alphanumeric characters
              are allowed. there's a limited set of those characters in the ascii.
            * The constraint is now part of your solution.

> `note to self:`For step 3 I noticed the book and other sources recommend, writing in a
> paper and
> going
> over the algorithm before start writing. During practice that didn't work for me. I
> needed to write bad code first, then refactor.

I also generally write the code on my own IDE (when possible), with the test case
calling the function.

**Big Words Warning:** `Feedback loop` - I need to see the code running (often not
running),
to understand the path I'm taking.

* _While you code it's important to explain what you're doing_
