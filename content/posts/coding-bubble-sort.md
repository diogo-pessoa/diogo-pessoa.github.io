## Summary

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,
compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.


- [My implementation](https://github.com/diogo-pessoa/coding-exercises-for-interviews/tree/main/algorithms/bubblesort)

## How it works

1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare each pair of adjacent elements.
3. If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
4. Move to the next pair and repeat the process until the end of the list is reached.
5. Repeat the process for the entire list until no swaps are needed.

* Time Complexity:
    * Worst-case:
        * `ùëÇ(ùëõ2)`
    * Best-case:
        * `O(n)` when the array is already sorted
    * Average-case:
        * `O(n2)`
* Space Complexity:
    * `O(1)` - As it‚Äôs an in-place sorting algorithm
