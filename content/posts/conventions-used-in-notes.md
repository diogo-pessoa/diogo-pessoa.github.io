# Summary

This was initially part of each note I wrote, but I decided to move it to a separate,
because it kept growing as I added random mumblings. I could have reviewed, but I'm just
moving here. I'm the only one using this anyway.

## Conventions Used in the notes

I'm borrowing the approach, I often see in O'Reilly books. I think it's really cool, and
it helps as you reads other books following a similar convention. Here it goes:

* _Italic_ - I'll use for quotations from the book: _The following typographical
  conventions are used in this book:_
* `code` - I'll use this for code snippets, as intended in markdowns. However, I'll also
  use it to call attention to my personal notes.
    * `note to self` - `[Revised]` - these notes will come in a > blockquote too.
* `[Revised]` - yeah, that came just after the update on the previous bullet. If I'm
  updating something, `[Revised]` will follow the change (hopefully, I'll tell me why).
* `(random comments inline)` - yeah, it's superbad practice, but I often, add
  comments mid-sentence `(most of them useless, see what I did here?)`. That's just how
  my brain works, and I noticed, I enjoy my reading later when I have those. It's like
  I'm feed my need for a distraction, by embedding it in the text. :thinking:
    * `(I held a vote, and I won)`.
* **Big Words Warning:** - That's for when I'm using cunning words to sound
  sophisticated, but serves the puporse of anchoring to a familiar idea.
* **_"Quotes"_** â€“ author - when I'm quoting literally quoting the author, I'll use this
  format.
* I'll liberally use emojis, This is a personal note, get over it.
* I might throw in some other markdown stuff, I can't think of now, and can't be
  bothered to look up.
    * [Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) - that will do.
* Check Glossary of terms in the end of each note. In Technical books, there's a lot of jargon,
  Acronyms, and contractions. All of which I often forget.
