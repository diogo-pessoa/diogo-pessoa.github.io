## Summary

Legos are awesome, I'm 37, and I still take my time building, browsing and reading about
them. The Lego brick system is a fantastic analogy for modular systems.

My reflection in this post though is that hiring new talent to build such systems should
be about the "bricks".

### The Lego System, system design and the Bezos Api-mandate

If you are
designing a new system for your application, the analogy transfers well. The popular
reference to Jeff Bezos' mandate to his teams at Amazon to build systems that are "
loosely coupled, but highly cohesive" is a good example of this. To stay on the Amazon
wagon for a moment. Regardless of the "
API-Mandate". When hiring, Amazon has a radically different approach. They rely heavily
on the Leadership principles. The hiring process is not only about the technical
skills `(although if you fit the LPs you'll probably have a high standard)`. It's
about the candidate's ability to think critically, a new-hire should bring something to
the table. Lps (leadership principle), such as Disagree and commit, hire and develop the
best.

### People are not Lego Bricks (my problem with hiring process)

After finishing-uo my last full-time role, I've been interviewing with a number of
companies. That is where I
see most interviewers are missing the point.

The hiring process feels as the "Lego brick" system. The candidate is tested on their
ability to build a lego set. It's no wonder the industry has such a heavy line of middle
level managers `(which, are quite frankly, create more impediments than they solve)`. In
Mythical Man Month,
Chapter 7 - _Why did the Babel tower fail?_, Fred Brooks discusses the idea of the "
Interfaces of communication".:

**_If there are n workers on a project, there are (n2-n)/2 interfaces across which there
may be communication, and there are potentially almost 2n teams within which
coordination must occur._**



### What should we focus on when hiring?

Smart creative people, capable of coming-up with new ideas, such as the Lego brick
system itself, will never fit in the brick model. If you are hire and test skills of the
best lego
builder. She'll build you a human-sized lego death-star. What this new-hire won't do is
come-up with the idea for the Lego bricks or the death-star itself.

I believe there's a fit for every kind of employee, some roles simply require a
procedural non-creative approach. Therefore, have your process reflect that.

If however, the company is looking for new ideas, disruptive thinkers and creative
knowledge workers, forget the system, that's what probation periods are for. One may
argue that it's costly to hire and fire, but it's even more costly to hire the wrong
person. the opportunity cost is much higher.

In the new era of Large language models, the idea of hiring a "lego builder" is frankly,
a disaster in the making. Company that hire very well, with well defined coding
challenges, or highly structured processes, will end-up with very good engineer a "
Senior GPT output parser".

As Edward Gibson discussed
in [Lex podcast interview](https://lexfridman.com/edward-gibson-transcript/#chapter8_llms).
Large language models are great `"FORM"` `(to our analogy, great at build lego sets)`.
At
generating text. They are not creative machines (or
judgemental) machines. They are
not capable of coming up with new ideas, it's a prediction machine. It's fantastic, and
sometimes it feels almost like it's holding a proper
conversation. `(As I write this note, I'm using Copilot and it's saving me a while lot of typing)`

### Conclusion

The field is changing, and so should the hiring process.
Critical thinking, collaborative and creative thinking should be the focus. Sit-down
with the candidate and code, sure, but not to see `if` he `can` write code to use a
hash-table. But why should he consider a different data-structure. How he approaches
problems, how he collaborates,
how he communicates, most importantly, does the candidate enjoy the conversation?

I've sat through interviews where the conversation was engaging only to be cut short
because we only have 45 minutes. `(screw that)` :sweat_smile:, it's at that point that
the interviewer should continue, if the candidate is available and willing, go further.

The saddest feeling I have is the sensation that the industry is becoming "
professional", and not in a good way. Software engineering, architecting is becoming a
factory job. Conditions are much better and benefits uncomparable, to factory job. But,
my point here is the repetitive nature of the job. The lack of creativity, the lack of "
invention".

I'm fully aware a developer can't always be inventing. But, that doesn't mean that daily
problems can't be resolved creatively. Sacrifing creating deep-thinking in favour of SLA
and runbooks is a mistake. The industry is moving towards a "professional" model, where
the engineer is a "operator" and not a "knowledge worker". The difference is subtle,
but it's there.

## Glossary

### The Lego System

The LEGO System, often referred to as the LEGO brick system, is a modular construction
toy system produced by the LEGO Group. The system revolves around interlocking plastic
bricks, gears, figurines, and various other parts that can be assembled and connected in
countless ways to construct objects, buildings, vehicles, and more.

It's fantastic idea for modular systems. If you are designing a new system for your
application, the analogy transfers well. The popular reference to Jeff Bezos' mandate to
his teams at Amazon to build systems that are "loosely coupled, but highly cohesive" is
a good example of this.
