## Conventions

* _Italic_ - I'll use for quotations from the book: _The following typographical
  conventions are used in this book:_
* `code` - I'll use this for code snippets, as intended in markdowns. However, I'll also
  use it to call attention to my personal notes.

* `[Revised]` - When I revisit a topic to correct or rewrite with a differente perspective.
*
* `(random comments inline)` - Adding some personal thoughts or memory anchors.
* **Warning:** - To reference a lesson learned or section that is still not clear to me.
* **_"Quotes"_** â€“ author - Direct quotations, with link to references section.

* Extra markdowns formating as
  needed: [Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) - that will do.
* **Glossary of terms**. In Technical writing jargon,
  Acronyms, and contractions are inevitable. `(per-note glossary)`
