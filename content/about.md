## none of the above

If you're none of the above, and you landed here by mistake,

I'm sorry, and :wave: bye.

If you're really trying to understand why this page, Here's a long explanation.

It's for `selfish reasons` :grimacing:. I'm bad at retaining information. Therefore, I
write a lot, Github pages platform.

I could continue
using [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) `(which, is damn great and free, and safe, I should, write a note about Joplin)`.

The problem is, I don't care enough about my own opinion, so I don't
edit`(or curate)` my notes. Writing it here, gave me the impression of exposure, and my
enormous ego, assumed that somebody else will actually read. Pair that with my
self-consciousness.
I end-up organizing the
ideas `(yes, that's organized, you should see the before–and-after)`. Simply because I
can't stand the judgement of the nonexistent reader.

### Disclaimer

* I'm writing for future me, and intentionally structure the text dumbing it down.
* I'll often drift off-topic, when it gets to bad I'll split into a separate note.
* If you're reading this `(and you're not me)`. I apologize this may look chaotic.
* I do hope you find something useful here.
* If you're still reading, I'm
  impressed. `(nothing better to do huh? Here, let me help, try cat videos: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/))`

* If you're still reading any of this. I created a separate page with to help understand
  the
  structure.
    * [Conventions]({{< ref "posts/conventions-used-in-notes" >}} "conventions-used")
* I'll eventually get to review the grammar and structures `(self-concious, remember?)`.
  But the goal is to jot down notes and write to retain ideas. Not to write a
  book. `(yet... nah, seriously I have no ilusions of writing a book.)` :
  thinking:.
* Many initial assumptions will be wrong and hopefully corrected. I have a `[Revised]`
  tag when I clear-up a topic.
* I Wrote with the intention
  humour `(despite being told repeatedly. I'm not funny. I guess, that makes me perseverant)`,
  these are technical notes, and letting loose will help with the learning process. It
  helps me when reading over.`(In fairness, I find myself funny. So, that's one of us)`.
* I'm with the assumption that I'm explaining to someone else. That said, that someone
  is me. "_that is also
  me_" `(that's a reference to COCO movie, when skeletion Frida's is on a Papaya, if you haven't watched it, you should)`.

Lastly, I'll leave you with a quote:

It goes both ways, for me when writing and for you when reading. I'll do my best to
revise often. If you don't like it, remember:
`“...opinions differ significantly from arse-holes, in that yours should be constantly and thoroughly examined.”`
