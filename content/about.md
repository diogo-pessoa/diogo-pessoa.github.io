## About me

Experienced Cloud Solution Architect & DevOps Engineer with expertise in cloud architecture, automation, and security. Adept at technical consulting, cloud migrations, and infrastructure modernization, with proven ability to optimize performance and cost efficiency. Extensive hands-on experience in AWS and GCP production environments. Passionate about automation, CI/CD pipelines, security best practices, and operational excellence.


### Also a Data Nerd

I'm passionate about data and how it can improve our lives. I believe Data Analytics is deservedly
the trending topic of the decade. Data, for me, it permeates everything from work to personal life. Trow
the dice and there's probability, check the weather and there's data. Watching the finals crunch the
stats. Yeah, Data is important, but what it really is for me is **fun**. Spreadsheet, data frames or
a plain of matrix, I'll take it over a movie any day.
