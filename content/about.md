## About me

I'm DevOps enthusiast, passionate about automating the software release process. Automate yourself
out of a job. I believe in delivering secure, fast, and efficient pipelines allowing for quick
deployments, testable features, and zero downtime deployments. The new
versions of your software should improve the customer's experience.
Good software is software that delivers customer value and adapts. I am accustomed to working in
fluent environments, leveraging modern
technologies and re-designing often. Delivering consistent, adaptable software continuously.
Automation and adaptability are key for reliable systems.

### Also a Data Nerd

I'm passionate about data and how it can improve our lives. I believe Data Analytics is deservedly
the trending topic of the decade. Data, for me, it permeates everything from work to personal life. Trow
the dice and there's probability, check the weather and there's data. Watching the finals crunch the
stats. Yeah, Data is important, but what it really is for me is **fun**. Spreadsheet, data frames or
a plain of matrix, I'll take it over a movie any day.
